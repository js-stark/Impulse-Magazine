All of us are depending on electricity to such an extent that even an hour of power-cut can stop the momentum of our life .Electricity has prominence in the view of a country\'s economic growth  , aiding the development of industrial, agriculture and infrastructure sectors. India is the world\'s third largest producer and third largest consumer of electricity. The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 371.054 GW.\r\n\r\nThermal power generation plant is the most conventional source of electric power. More than 65% of India\'s electricity generation capacity comes from thermal power plants, with 85% of the country\'s thermal power generation being coal-based.  In a thermal power station heat energy is converted to electric power. The main source of energy is coal . A steam-driven turbine converts heat to mechanical power as an intermediate to electrical power. Water is heated, turned into steam and is made to rotate the steam turbine which drives a generator. After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a condenser and resent to where it was heated.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the energy needs of the state of Tamil Nadu, TNEB has a total installed capacity of 18,747.28 MW which includes shares from the State government, Central government and Independent power producers. Owing to the necessity to achieve the status of a developed country ,the  increase in electricity demand is inevitable . It is thus mandatory to utilize energy effectively, efficiently and responsibly .\r\nGlancing at the present energy supply chain system, an enormous amount of energy is being wasted at various steps which has caused a very poor efficiency of the system. This is the most worrying and perturbative realistic fact of our current power system\r\n\r\nThe different stages of the system from transmission to distribution and subsequent consumption have their own efficiency depending on the losses which occur in the components/equipment of the system. Due to the cascading efficiency the overall system efficiency results  to 50% of the system efficiency. Because of this poor performance of the electric supply chain,  end users are able to use only half of the energy which is being generated at power plants.In the last ten years the electricity consumption has soared by 42% which means overall consumption per year increment is 4.2% . Among other sectors agricultural, domestic and commercial sector energy demand has increased at a much faster pace. Hence, these sectors have considerable energy saving potentials.\r\n\r\nWhy do we waste electricity?\r\n\r\nOften we do not waste electricity for any bad intentions but owing to our negligence and casual practices of electricity usage , wastage occurs .The few probable reasons might be :\r\n\r\n->Lack of awareness about the importance of energy conservation\r\n->Use of inefficient equipment/appliances\r\n->Unmetered loads\r\n->Negligent way of handling of energy utilities\r\n->Failing to monitor & audit energy consumption bills.\r\n->Why  do we need to save/conserve electricity?\r\n\r\nElectricity is not only the fuel for our daily life but is also vital for country\'s economic growth (GDP growth).\r\nReduce impacts of fossil fuels on environment as a coal based power plant emits 1.1Kg(average) of CO for producing 1 unit(kWh) of electricity. Oil, Gas & Coal are likely to last for only 20 years, 36 years & 114 years respectively as per current reserve production(R/P) ratio.\r\nPreserve next generation as reserves are limited; we have Oil, Gas, Coal reserves of only 0.5% , 0.6% & 7% respectively of the total world reserves. The escalation in fossil fuels dependence for energy production will be fatal in the long run .Current electricity generation is predominately depending on fossil fuels(71% ) which include; coal (59.6%), Gas(9%), Oil(0.52%) & Nuclear(1.9%).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nEnergy efficiency can be achieved with every individual\'s commitment to save resources for the forthcoming generation and the willingness to share the available resources with the under-privileged people of our society. Each one of us has responsibility in spreading the awareness and understanding the criticalness of saving electrical energy even while consuming. This is the time to think and act very smartly in order to avoid or  minimize the wastage of even one unit of electrical energy as the \' 1 unit energy saved by user is equal to 2 units energy generated \'  in the power plant.

Some witty people think the virus won\'t last long. Among all these chaos and confusion, growing a virus in your shoes sounds weird and crazy. Viruses thereby hold pervasive importance and an enormous significance in peoples\' life which has a respectable history of captivating people\'s interest and attention.\r\nA 2013 study reported evidence of around 320,000 different viruses that could potentially infect mammals alone. But one among them dated to around 270 million years old and referred scientifically as M-13 Bacteriophage is capable of generating electricity. Having laid its roots in the Permian period this virus has a rapid replication capacity and is composed of circular single-stranded DNA as its genetic material.\r\n\r\nSo how is it even possible for a virus to produce electricity?\r\n\r\nThe answer lies in the fact that this virus exhibits piezoelectric effect [Piezoelectric effect is a property of a material which can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy]. For instance, recently the floors of the party halls in big hotels like \'Renaissance Mumbai\' were laid with piezoelectric material. When people start dancing the pressure they exert on the floor gets transformed into electrical energy powered the LED lights\r\n\r\nThe icing on the cake is that M-13 bacteriophages grow in clusters and can be stacked like matchsticks inside a matchbox. So when we apply pressure on the virus colony the charges on them get partially separated as positive and negative. They do this by pumping positive ions of metals like Sodium, Potassium and Calcium outside of their membrane envelope. So the outside of the cells becomes slightly positive compared to inside. So each virus is capable of generating a resting voltage of 0.065 volts. Even human cells are capable of generating mild voltages but our cells aren\'t organized in a way that would let us add those voltages together. These viruses can be stacked in long chains like batteries inside a flashlight and each of these cells joins end to end to form a nerve fibre-like structure. Hence when the viruses charge up little pores open up in their membrane envelope allowing those positive ions to rush into the cell. Thereby each cell becomes like a little tiny battery. Instead of having a negative inside and positive outside, the cells now have a negative left side and positive right side. And just like in a battery, electrons flow between the two ends to equalize the charge. Since the cells are stacked in chains like positive to negative to positive and so on, the voltage of each cell adds up with every other cell in the chain.\r\n\r\nThese viruses create a constant electric field around themselves, usually with a power of only a few nano-watts. They use this to sense their immediate environments and know other viruses or bacteria nearby. Some say they use this to communicate with the host cell they infect using distinct patterns of discharges. You might be wondering why we didn\'t evolve to create awesome electric fields that we can control with our minds. Well because we can see and hear. Seeing and hearing may seem kind of boring compared to being electrified. But these viruses use a lot less energy than electro genesis that the human tissues employ for producing electricity.\r\n\r\nMuch recently a group of researchers from Berkeley Lab, California reported that these viruses could be grown inside the sole of specialized shoes. As people walk and run the pressure they create squeezes the viral cells inside the shoe which in turn are capable of generating electricity. The power output could be harnessed and stored in a battery. And also these viruses are not harmful to humans. Now, this seemed to be a lucrative and successful strategy for generating green and clean energy. So they got patented in 2016, but official announcements regarding the manufacturing and mass production of those shoes are yet to be announced. Who knows, we might be walking with viruses pretty soon!                          '),

I rushed to store room searching for a torch. I took the dusty crystal lamp in an old briefcase. When I dusted it, some electric sparks encircled the room and with huge noise. Boom! A monster appeared and introduced himself as the man of electric charges in a bold voice. He said, â€œThank you Owner, I am voltageâ€.  I was stunned. I thought he might be a magical monster and ordered him to get me an â€˜iPhoneâ€™.  He burst into laughter, saying â€œOh stupid! I am not a monster as you thinkâ€.  â€œI am here to fulfill your three wishes, but only on one condition-your wish should be regarding electricityâ€.\r\n\r\n               My greediness emerged out of my brain, so I asked, â€œCould you make me an electrical scientist?â€ Monster gave me a cheap look and asked, â€œOK, My Lordâ€¦what do you want to discover?â€ I said, â€œHelp me out to discover a way for the production of electricity by just pressingâ€. He knocked me into and said, â€œOh mad! It has been already discovered by Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie in 1880. This is known as Piezoelectric Effect (ability of certain materials to generate an electrical charge due to applied mechanical stress). It was first found in tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, Rochelle salt. It is reversible. Here, the voltage produced is proportional to the stress applied. Certain materials exhibiting this effect are piezoelectric materials. It is of three types,\r\n\r\nNatural\r\nArtificial\r\nPolarised ferroelectric materialsâ€.\r\n\r\n                  He then explained the production of polarised ferroelectric material. â€œThe ferroelectric material is polarised by applying strong electric field while heating it above curie point temperature. It is left to cool for some time. While removing electric field, permanent polarisation occurs which allows it to exhibit this effect. To your surprise shall I say something? I came out of the crystal because of this effectâ€. I wondered.\r\n\r\n                I asked him to explain the applications clearly. He replied, â€œYeah. Of course. It has been applied in watch, knock sensor, transducer, mike, lighter, buzzer, etc. First, let me explain about its role in watchâ€. He shrunk me as small as an ant and asked me to close my eyes. When I opened my eyes, I was inside the watch and all components inside it revived and started talking. One of the components came near me and introduced, â€œHi, I am battery. Welcome to Titan Quartz Watch World. I supply necessary voltage requiredâ€. Next, I went to the microchip and greeted him, â€œHello!â€ Microchip didnâ€™t even utter a word and kept on doing its duty. The electric man made fun of me, â€œHe is the busi2est man. Simply saying, he is not like you, lazy!â€. He continued, â€œMicrochip sends the electric charges receiving from battery to the crystal. Due to inverse piezoelectric effect, crystal begins to oscillate and as you know, by piezoelectric effect, it produces electric charges (due to crystal oscillation) which is supplied to microchip. Crystal oscillates for 32768 times per second and when it reaches 32768th oscillation, microchip signals the electric motor to run the wheels attached to the watch â€.\r\n\r\nWORKING OF WATCH\r\n\r\n                     â€œWow!â€, I exclaimed with joy and took my phone to take selfie. He said, â€œHey child! Selfie is prohibited hereâ€. I didnâ€™t listen to him, I started taking photos and selfie with all the components. I have given here some pics for your reference.\r\n\r\nWATCH WHEEL\r\n\r\nQUARTZ CRYSTAL\r\n\r\n             I asked him to explain about the knock sensor. He took me into carâ€™s engine. It was too hot there and I asked him to switch on the AC. He glared at me, meanwhile knock sensor invited us and started to explain about him. â€œNoise at reverberation range of\r\n\r\n6 â€“ 8 Hz is produced, when detonation occurs. The resonating plates attached to me resonates under this rangeâ€. I continued, â€œThen by piezoelectric effect, you will produce electric signal which will be passed to Engine Control Module (ECM) to delay the detonation. Am I right?â€ Sensor replied, â€œYes!â€\r\n\r\nKNOCK SENSOR\r\n\r\n                     Then monster and sensor together announced, â€œWithout us, you canâ€™t have a safe journey!â€ I interrupted them, â€œAre you crazy? Do you mean without you, car wonâ€™t run properly!â€ â€œOK, then wait and watch!â€, he ranted. During this conversation, monster threw out the sensor and the very next second, the car blasted off.\r\n\r\n                    I thought, I would be in either hell or heaven. But surprisingly, I was safe! I was in the store room and I thanked for saving me. He bid me goodbye saying that all my 3 wishes were fulfilled. I was speechless and stammered, â€œOh man! I didnâ€™t even begin to ask for a boonâ€. Monster laughed aloud, â€œYou should be careful while asking your wishes. I hope it will help you in semester examsâ€ and he disappeared. I mumbled, â€œOops, thatâ€™s my 12th syllabus dudeâ€, cursing myself for my stupidity.'),

Be it either mobiles or laptop chargers or television sets. How many of you have been pissed off when your phone runs out of charge at the exact moment when you need it the most. It hurts right? But thatâ€™s all about to change!\r\n\r\nThere is no argument in that we humans love electricity. We love that stuff so much that we can get an idea about it just by walking out on the street. There are about trillions of money spent in setting up power stations and wires carrying electricity from where it is generated to our homes and offices. Not only this. We love batteries too! An object that gives us power for a while before ending up in the garbage. Have you ever given a thought of what happens after you throw off a battery??â€¦we donâ€™t because we are not benefitted from it anymoreâ€¦. But then there is a negative aspect to all these. Wires and batteries are awful. Just think about it, overhead wires get damaged in rough weather and can lead to calamities that may claim a human life. Plus imagine getting tangled in one of those wires under your computer desk. I know itâ€™s patheticâ€¦\r\n\r\nAs for the batteries, nearly 40 billion of them are manufactured every year and when their work is done, they fall apart, disintegrate and end up in junkyard or oceans slowly decaying and releasing harmful stuff into the environment.\r\n\r\nImagine what if there was a technology through which we could build something that will never require us to plug our computers and phones into plug points ever again. Thatâ€™s where wireless electricity (WiTricity) comes into the picture.\r\n\r\nThe earliest vision of wireless electricity was thought by Nikola Tesla. As an engineer and inventor, he dedicated his whole life to work with electricity. But his vision of world running on wireless electricity was made possible by an MIT professor on his third sleepless night.\r\n\r\nMIT Professor Marin SoljaÄiÄ‡ stood in his pajamas looking at his phone. This was the 6th time in that month that he was woken up by the beeping of his phone warning him that the battery was low. In those moments a thought occurred to him. â€œThere is electricity wired all through my house, my office and everywhere. The phone should take care of its own charging!â€ But to make this dream into a reality, one has to find a way to transfer power from these wired infrastructures to the phone wirelessly. SoljaÄiÄ‡ started working on a physical phenomenon that would make this possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, SoljaÄiÄ‡ with a group of MIT physicists was able to power a light bulb of about 60 watts from a distance of two meters wirelessly. It was around 50% efficient which is still a thousand times more efficient than what a battery would be to perform the same task. The concept behind it was called the resonant energy transfer.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment, one of the coils was connected to an AC power supply having a resonant source. The other coil having a resonant capture device was connected to a 60W light bulb. They were suspended in mid-air by a nylon thread at a distance ranging from a few centimeters to 2.5 meters. The power supply was able to light the bulb wirelessly.\r\n\r\nThe experiment carried out by SoljaÄiÄ‡ and his students in 2007\r\n\r\nSo what is resonance?\r\n\r\nWhen two objects vibrate at the same frequency they are said to be in resonance. And the frequency at which they are vibrating is called resonating frequency. The energy can be transferred between two resonating objects at some distances.\r\n\r\nTry to understand it like this, inside a transformer, there are two coils of wires. They are very close to each other and transfer energy from one coil to another magnetically and wirelessly. But this phenomenon occurs over a very short distance. What do? SoljaÄiÄ‡ did was separate the coils in the transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers and make it work somehow\r\n\r\nHow WiTricity technology works:\r\n\r\nImagine a coil with a capacitor attached to it. If we can make this coil to resonate, what happens is that it will pulse at a resonating current frequency which is fairly high. And if a â€œpower capture coilâ€ is brought close near to the source such that it will only work at the same frequency, what happens is the magnetic field will induce a current in the capture coil and a magnetic field around it. The magnetic fields of these two coils couple tightly and they transfer power efficiently.\r\n\r\nIn simple words whatâ€™s actually happening is you convert electricity into the magnetic field and take that magnetic field and turn it back into electricity to use it but over some distance.\r\n\r\nWhat are its benefits?\r\n\r\nThis non-radioactive power transfer works on magnetic fields and is 100% safe in nature. Itâ€™s almost the same as the earthâ€™s magnetic field. It reduces the cost compared to wired connectors. And imagine how convenient it would actually be in day to day life for charging everyday electronics. It is also a very safe way of power transfer. Whatever the job may be difficult or dirty or dangerous, wireless power delivers reliable and sustainable power.\r\n\r\nWhat is the future of WiTricity?\r\n\r\nWe can look forward to a world in which wireless power is integrated into all parts of everyday life. Wireless electricity is still a very new concept in its development phase but it holds a wide range of applications where it can be used. The applications where it has been tested efficiently range from household appliances to industrial applications. We have been able to charge cell phones wirelessly and have been able to turn on our television sets wirelessly.\r\n\r\nWireless power holds potential for its uses in hospitals as it can provide a cleaner and more hygiene environment. It can be used in implanted medical devices which will reduce infection. Imagine walking into your room and your desktop turning on automatically. Or imagine a wireless home where you place your lamp anywhere and it lights up or your phone charging while itâ€™s still in your pocket. Imagine a world without wires. The idea is revolutionary! â€¦..yet a Hell long Way to go. Is it too much to ask for? Not at allâ€¦We just need to believe that If somebody can do it then we can do it. If No one has done it Then we should Do itâ€¦â€¦..                          '),

Every discovery is a form of technology. Most people use it as a blessing while some people use it to create disaster. No doubt that we live in the age of technology where it has become an important part of our life but sometimes it can act as hindrances. Let’s see the one of hindrance in this article.\r\n\r\nELECTROMAGNETIC BOMB:\r\n\r\nA bomb is an explosive device that uses the explosive material to produce an exothermic reaction, but electromagnetic bomb is somewhat different from the other bombs, as it does not produce explosion. Rather it produces high powerful radiation that damages the electronics equipment\'s.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLE:\r\n\r\nThe basic principle of Electromagnetic bomb is an effect of Electromagnetic Pulses (EMP).The Electromagnetic pulses is an electromagnetic shock. The pulses of energy produces a powerful electromagnetic field sufficiently strong to produce short lived transient voltages of thousand of volts on exposed electrical conductors like wires, Printed circuit board,….etc. This can cause irreversible damage to wide range of electrical and electronics equipment particularly computers and radio or radar devices.\r\n\r\nTechnologies based on EMP:\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests Electromagnetic Pulses or waves is the keyhole of Electromagnetic bombs. The technology bases of Electromagnetic bombs are.\r\n\r\nMagnetic Flux Compression Generators:\r\n\r\nIt has six key components like armature, explosive, plane wave generator, stator coils, detonator and a small capacitor. A switch connects the capacitors to the stator which provides starting current. A fuse mechanism ignites the explosive materials. As the explosion makes its way through the cylinder, the cylinder comes in contact with the stator winding. This creates a short circuit, cutting the stator off from its power supply. The moving short circuit compresses the magnetic field, generating an intense electromagnetic burst.  The graph infers that as the time increases the flux compressed generator rate increases exponentially to the peak of the normalized amplitude and then decreases.\r\n\r\nVirtual Cathode Oscillator or Vircator:\r\n\r\nA Vircator (Virtual Cathode oscillator) is a microwave generator that is capable of producing brief pulses of tunable, narrow band microwave at very high power levels. It consists of an cathode, injected with electron beam having a magnitude in range of kilovolts within a duration of 50 – 150 nanoseconds. The electrons are attracted to a thin anode generally made of an aluminized polyethylene terephthalate which is connected to a grounded waveguide body. Due to the high intensity of the electron beam, many electrons pass through the anode into a region beyond it, forming a virtual cathode which causes oscillations and generate microwaves.\r\n\r\nWorking of Electromagnetic Bomb:\r\n\r\nWorking of Electromagnetic Bomb is nothing but it says how the power from the Electromagnetic Bomb is coupled into targets (where we exhibit the electromagnetic pulse effect).It consists of two types of Power Coupling.\r\nFront Door coupling: It coupling occurs through antennas and destroys the RF semiconductors in receivers and transmitters.\r\n\r\nBack door coupling: It occurs through power and data cables and wiring, and can damage both power supplies, data receiver and transmitter devices, and if propagated into the equipment any other devices exposed.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n\r\n->Not lethal to humans.\r\n->Negligible collateral damage.\r\n->No mass media coverage of bombing casualties (broadcast equipment destroyed) will reduce threshold for the use of strategic air power \r\n   and missile forces.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n\r\n->Difficulty in kill assessment.\r\n->Means of delivering E-bombs are difficult.\r\n->Atmospheric propagation of pulse.\r\n->Military equipment are vulnerable.\r\n->The E-Bomb enables rapid attraction of every electronic assets over large areas.'),

N', 'israel-palacio-ImcUkZ72oUs-unsplash.jpg', '                            The main motivation behind vehicular communication systems is safety and eliminating the excessive traffic collisions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road accidents annually cause approximately 1.2 million deaths worldwide; one-fourth of all deaths caused by the injury. Also, about 50 million persons are injured in traffic accidents. If preventive measures are not taken, road accidents are likely to become the third-leading cause of death in 2020 from ninth place in 1990. What we should understand is that as Electrical engineers, we need to contribute to the well-being of our country in the best possible way.\r\n\r\n1.Vehicle communication , In order to define vehicle communications, one must first differentiate between the different types of communication that take place between vehicles. There are two types of vehicle communication:\r\n\r\n->Intra-vehicle communication is reference communications that occur within a vehicle.\r\n->Inter-vehicle communication represents communications between vehicles or between vehicles and sensors placed in or on various \r\n  locations, such as roadways, signs, parking areas, and even the home garage.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, a considerable amount of research has occurred in the area of inter-vehicle communications oriented towards providing safety features and expanded capabilities to vehicles. One such example is Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET). The idea is to form groups of vehicles in order to allow relaying information from one vehicle to another vehicle. A second area of research is oriented towards the concept of  intelligent roads. The idea is to enable vehicles to seamlessly gather information from any combination of signs, displays, sensors, and transponders.\r\n\r\nVehicle-to-Roadside communications\r\n\r\nTraffic light: Commonly, traffic lights are passive devices that simply switch from one color to another. Nowadays, more and more traffic lights in urban areas integrate various electronic equipment in order to survey road traffic. We may use video cameras placed at strategic locations to take photographs of drivers and license plates of vehicles that jump red lights. We can easily assume that in the near future, the color of traffic signals could be broadcast to approaching vehicles. Vehicle-integrated electronics could therefore automatically adjust vehicles speed (either slow down if the light changes from yellow to red or slightly accelerate if the light is green).\r\n\r\nRoad junction: A road junction is statistically a major hotspot for accidents. It is quite easy to imagine that in the near future, vehicle-integrated electronics could automatically slow the vehicles speed as it approaches and other hotspots based on the history of road accidents.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of an intelligent transportation system include:\r\n\r\n 1) the improvement of trip security\r\n\r\n2) the improvement of the global efficiency of the transportation system by reducing travel time and congestion\r\n\r\n3) the integration of transportation in durable development policy, particularly by reducing gas.\r\n\r\nWe, as drivers must also follow some basic things like following the traffic lights and not driving the vehicle above the speed limit to ensure the safety of the driver and the others on the road. Merely possessing a license isn\'t going to make one a safe driver. Let\'s hope that the inter-vehicular communication will bring a revolutionary change in the upcoming days.

The X in this term can be Hydrogen, Methane, Heat, or again back to power when needed. The power for this technology is derived from renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar PV, etc., which has been drastically increased during the past decade. According to the Energy Statistics of India 2021, the electricity supply has been increased from 8,11,635 GWh in 2010-2011 to 13,11,176 GWh in 2019-2020 which is a 61% increase. The availability of electricity increased by 0.27% in the previous year alone. The amount of electricity consumed in 2019-2020 is 12,91,494 GWh which is lesser than the production. The excess electricity produced can be converted into other forms of fuels like hydrogen, methane, etc.,\r\n\r\nWHY POWER TO X TECHNOLOGY?\r\nWe already know that the temperature of the earth has been increased due to global warming. Global warming is caused by greenhouse gases such as CO2. It is now necessary to find fuels that are eco-friendly so that our earth can be safe. The Power to X technology paves the way to decarbonize our earth. The emission of CO2 and CO are majorly from vehicles and the burning of fossil fuels like coal. In this technology, electric power can be converted into fuels that can replace fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nHOW DOES THIS TECHNOLOGY WORK?\r\nElectric power is converted into gaseous fuels like hydrogen, methane, syngas, also converted into heat, food, etc., The major process involved in this conversion is Electrolysis. The fuels are synthesized from electrolysis processes utilizing electricity.\r\n\r\nPOWER TO GAS\r\n1.POWER TO HYDROGEN\r\n4% of global hydrogen is produced by electrolysis\r\n\r\n    Steps involved:\r\n\r\n    POWER GENERATION     -->    ELECTROLYSER     -->     HYDROGEN  \r\n\r\n\r\nHydrogen fuel is used for transport and industries. The power produced from renewable sources like solar PV, wind power is converted to hydrogen, then stored for later use. Therefore hydrogen becomes the complementary carrier of renewable energy. According to IRENA, to achieve the decarbonization targets and global energy transformation, hydrogen production from renewable electricity should reach 19EJ in 2050.\r\n\r\nElectrolysis:\r\n     When electricity is supplied water splits into hydrogen and oxygen. This hydrogen is stored and utilized later.\r\n\r\n1.Alkaline electrolysis:\r\n\r\n         ->For commercial hydrogen production, Alkaline electrolysis is used.\r\n         ->Electrolyte used- Liq alkaline solution of Sodium or Potassium.\r\n         ->Hydrogen is produced at Cathode. Optimum temperature-100-1500 C\r\n\r\n2.PEME (Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis) :\r\n\r\n         ->For commercial, small and medium scale applications(<300KW), PEM Electrolysis is used.\r\n         ->The electrolyte used- Solid specialty plastic material.\r\n         ->Water reacts at Anode to form oxygen and protons. Optimum temperature-70-900C.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell) :\r\n\r\n Electrolyte used-Solid ceramic material. Water reacts at the cathode, combines with electrons from an external circuit to form hydrogen gas \r\n and negatively charged oxygen ions. Hydrogen also couples renewable electricity with other energy sectors like feedstock, fuel, etc.,\r\n\r\n2.POWER TO METHANE:\r\n  Steps involved:\r\n        POWER GENERATION --> ELECTROLYSER --> HYDROGEN --> METHANE\r\n\r\nMethane is produced from Hydrogen and Carbon dioxide. Hydrogen produced from Power to hydrogen technology is then reacted with carbon dioxide to form methane. The carbon dioxide for this process is derived from biomass plants, power generation plants, and ambient air. Carbon dioxide emitted from industries is used in this process not only to obtain methane but also to avoid environmental pollution. In this process, the energy carrier is changed from hydrogen to methane which has high energy density than the former one. This reaction is exothermic due to which 17% of energy is liberated in the form of heat.\r\n\r\n3.POWER TO SYNGAS\r\nSyngas is a mixture of Hydrogen with Carbon Monoxide. Syngas is produced from the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen produced by the power to hydrogen technology. The syngas is then converted into synfuel. Synfuels include synthetic diesel, gasoline.\r\n\r\nPOWER TO HEAT\r\nCanada, China, Japan, US, and Europe all use power to heat technology.\r\n\r\n    Steps involved :\r\n\r\n   -> RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE --> ELECTRICITY --> HEATING AND COOLING\r\n\r\n Electric power is converted into efficient heating or cooling by the heat pumps or boilers. Power to heat technology using renewable sources reduces fossil fuels. Among the largest consumers of energy, Heating and cooling applications also take place. Especially in industries, 20% of global energy consumption is used for heating and cooling processes. Heat production is achieved in 2 ways:\r\n\r\n   (1) Direct conversion of renewable energy sources to heat.\r\n\r\n   (2) Power to heat:\r\n\r\n        Using electricity generated from renewable energy sources to produce heat via heat pump or boilers.\r\n       From IRENA analysis in 2050 in the building sector heat pumps will increase to over 250 million units, which will supply 27% of heat \r\n       demand. Also in an industry sector, 80 million heat pumps will be installed.\r\n\r\nPOWER TO FOOD\r\n        It is quite interesting to know that electric power can be converted into food. It may sound impossible but it is possible.\r\n\r\n      Steps involved:\r\n         ->ELECTRIC POWER --> HYDROGEN --> METHANE --> FOOD\r\n\r\nFrom methane, protein-rich feed for cattle and fish is made by a bacteria namely methylococcus capsulatus. In order to make our earth decarbonized it is necessary to switch eco-friendly methods. Power to X technology paves way for producing fuels in an eco-friendly manner.                                                                              '),

Focus towards integration of networks, especially those involving mapping user preferences, have made personal data possess unlimited value and uses. RFID is among the fastest growing technologies, and is set to take up the mantle of setting a new standard for data security.\r\n\r\nRFID (Radio Frequency Identification) utilizes EM fields for tracking the tags and transferring information wirelessly. The structure of a RFID system is fairly simple: antenna, receiver and a transponder(tag). It can either be passive or active. Active IDs transmit the radio signal whereas the passive version reflects the radio signal from the reader. Besides the basic functionality, RFIDs are offered in various frequency ranges and storage sizes, depending upon the international standard used.\r\n\r\nThe primary advantage of RFID exists in its versatility. Some RFID systems can be written and rewritten multiple times, using particular software. Besides this, the RFID smart tag variants offer much more functionality, as they combine human readable info and barcode technology. A smart label tag usually comprises of an adhesive label with a thin tag inlay. Modern RFIDs provide memory and chip functionality, enabling customization. The fact that RFID tags can be embedded on a variety of materials, along with the adoption of an international standard and contactless, non-LoC connection, places this technology at the forefront of wireless communications and data privacy.\r\n\r\nRFID\'s use in industries can be mainly observed in the domain of asset tracking. Previously, keeping track of assets was a tedious and error prone task. However, with RFID tagging, one can instantly find the general location of assets anywhere. Control points can be set up in order to instantly receive location data. Asset tracking provides a huge benefit in optimizing supply chains. Similarly, this concept can be extended to user data as well. Medical data of individuals can be tagged in order to ease the access of data. Any and all-important data, used for identification, can utilize this system efficiently.\r\n\r\nLike other tech, RFID is also exposed to security threats. However, as RFID tags mostly store data and don\'t execute code, they are safer in general. Besides this, the RFID tags are designed such that they verify data read from tags with a number of parameters. This, combined with encryptions of the data itself, makes RFID a viable option.\r\n\r\nRFID has undoubtedly made a huge impact in the technology world. The myriad of applications that this system provides makes it as one of the pillars of modern technology and will continue to integrate itself into various other industries.

EVs that are currently in production can offer a range of only 130 kilometers per charging cycle. To improve this parameter, batteries must have higher charge storage densities. Improving the performance of a typical lithium-ion battery while maintaining production costs once seemed like an impossible task, but not anymore.\r\n\r\nOneD Battery Sciences is a California-based battery developer thatâ€™s a pioneer in the field of nanotechnologies for EV batteries. Their recent breakthrough SINANODE promises to triple energy density while halving the cost of maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLithium-ion batteries work by generating free electrons at the anode, which create current as they flow through the load (say, motors). These free electrons come from lithium ions as they move from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. Lithium is stored by the anode and cathode inside the battery cell and the ion movement is regulated by an internal separator membrane. Traditionally, anodes and cathodes are composed of graphite layers and lithium-metal oxides respectively. For a high runtime from a single round of charging, it is crucial that the anode must have a high energy density, so the battery can provide the required current level for longer periods.\r\n\r\nSINANODE improves battery range by amalgamating silicon nanowires with commercially used graphite powders in the anode. During charging, electrons flow easily from the graphite into the silicon nanowires. Lithium ions also flow into the nanowires, resulting in a Li15Si4 alloy complex. During discharge, lithium ions and electrons are quickly released, amplifying the power density. The nanowire-graphite interface remains mechanically and electronically intact over repeated charging cycles. Moreover, the silicon nanowires are strong, flexible, and provide larger surface areas for charge release as compared to pure graphite powder. OneD claims that these features result in increased power levels, faster charging speeds, and improved battery lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive feat is that their silicon-graphite composite anode can be implemented right away, with existing industrial-scale electrode production technology. In addition, it is compatible with the other substrates, cell design parameters, and procedures used in contemporary battery manufacturing plants.\r\n\r\nHowever, one major flaw in SINANODEâ€™s system remains-since OneDâ€™s revolutionary new idea revolves entirely around integrating as much silicon into the anodes as possible, theyâ€™ve become highly dependent on a single element and an overused battery platform. Lithium is a finite and process-intensive resource. Mining for silicon releases toxic levels of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) into the local environment where it disrupts the processes of photosynthesis and respiration. As a result, an increasing number of researchers are contemplating alternatives to silicon-augmented lithium-ion batteries, including fuel cells, graphene supercapacitors, and bioelectrochemical batteries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, SINANODE batteries show a natural aptitude to make EV ownership more viable and consumer-friendly. Their higher silicon-to-graphite ratio also lowers the carbon footprint produced per kWh of energy used, which is the need of the hour to combat climate change. By aiming to enter production by early 2025, SINANODE looks set to take over the world and usher in the new era of high-range EVs!'),

HARI PRAKASH', 'Picture 1.jpg', '<b>INTRODUCTION</b>\r\n\r\nSensors are the small devices which detect the changes in the parameters in its environment and send the signals respectively.  Various sensors like voltage sensors, spark knock sensors, fuel temperature sensors, etc.,  are equipped in electric vehicles which makes them highly effective in several aspects.  Each sensors are designed for a specific purpose.  This article describes the uses of ultrasonic and lidar sensors in electric vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ULTRASONIC SENSORS</b>\r\n\r\nAutomotive Ultrasonic sensors are the sensors which detects the distance between the vehicle and the object (other vehicles / obstacles).  These sensors measures the distance using high frequency ultrasonic waves which are beyond the human hearing range (above 20kHz).  These sensors have two transducers, one to send and one to receive the signals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WORKING OF ULTRASONIC SENSORS</b>\r\n\r\nThe working of ultrasonic sensors is pretty simple.  High frequency ultrasonic waves are sent from a transducer (like speaker) which gets reflected by the objects in its surrounding.  The other transducer receives the reflected signal (like microphone) which will be further processed by a processor and then detects the distance between the vehicle and the obstacle by calculating the time delay in sending and receiving the signals and the velocity of the ultrasonic waves (which is a constant one). \r\nLet \r\nt - be the time delay in sending and receiving the signals\r\nv - the speed of the sound signal (340m/s in air)\r\nd - the distance between the object and the obstacle\r\nDistance (d) = (340 * t) / 2\r\nThese sensors basically have 4 pins namely Vcc, Trig, Echo and Gnd pins.  The Vcc pin is for the power supply.  The Gnd pin is the ground pin.  The trig pin is to send the signals by a transducer in a regular interval of time.  The Echo pin is to receive the reflected signals, converting them into electric pulses and feeding them into the processor.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LIDAR SENSORS</b>\r\n\r\nLIDAR is the abbreviated form of Light Detection and Ranging.  LIDAR sensors in the vehicles send the infrared waves which will be reflected from the obstacle which is processed to form a 3D virtual map which enables the vehicle into a self-driving mode.  There are two types of LIDARs.  (Time of Flight) ToF and Frequency modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LIDARs.  The former works by emitting the light in the form of pulses while the latter works by emitting the light in the form of continuous pulses.  Most of the automotive vehicles use various FMCW LIDARs.  Modern cars use various solid-state LIDARs instead of a rotating LIDAR.  These LIDARs normally have a 90-120 degree field of view.  These sensors are mounted on various positions of the vehicle to get a 360 degree field of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WORKING OF LIDAR SENSORS</b>\r\n\r\nThe LIDAR sensors have a source of light which emits the continuous light of infrared waves (basically billions of photons) which will be reflected back from the obstacles (like ultrasonic sensors).  These data are used to find the shape, movements (if any) of the obstacles.  A processor will combine all these data almost simultaneously and produce a real-time 3D virtual map of the world around the vehicle.  Self Driving mode uses these data and maps and controls the other parts of the vehicle like steering, brakes, accelerator, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ADVANTAGES OF ULTRASONIC AND LIDAR SENSORS</b>\r\n\r\n1)	Precise and reliable navigation\r\n2)	Guiding the Self-Driving mode\r\n3)	Highly useful in situations with low visibility\r\n4)	Useful in Parking\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CONCLUSION</b>\r\n\r\nThese sensors are a big boon for the automotive vehicles.  Even though there are various sensors in the automotive vehicles, these two sensors protect the life of the driver and passengers as they can control the vehicle by sensing the environment.\r\n                          ');

(37, 'March-19-2022-20:01:51', 'WAVE POWER DEVICES', 'Design', 'Arvind Sriram ', 'Pic1.jpeg', 'Nature is very beautiful and at the same time very bountiful. It is man who has to apply his knowledge to get the best out of nature. In this article, we are going to see such an amazing technology in which, we try to harness energy from the waves that form in the sea. Sounds interesting right? So let us take a deep dive into this amazing technology to understand it right from its fundamentals.\r\n\r\nWAVE POWER \r\nWave Energy (or wave power) is a form of energy that is harnessed from the sea waves. It is also a form of non-polluting renewable energy that can be used for many purposes such as electricity generation, desalination, pumping water, and many more. This energy is created by the natural transfer of wind energy over the oceans, which itself is created by the sunâ€™s solar energy. As the wind blows across the surface of the ocean, moving air particles transfer their energy to the water molecules that they touch.\r\nAs the wind continues to blow, its kinetic energy is transferred to the oceansâ€™ surface and the waves grow bigger. These larger waves are called gravity waves because their potential energy is mainly due to the gravitational force of the Earth. There is a lot of potential energy in the waves generated by the wind which can be harnessed and utilized for human purposes.\r\n\r\nWAVE POWER DEVICES\r\nWave power devices are said to be those devices that are capable of harnessing useful energy from the waves. Fundamentally, there are three types of wave power devices:\r\n1) Wave Profile devices: These kinds of devices convert the oscillating height of the waves (POTENTIAL ENERGY) into mechanical energy.\r\n2)Wave Capture Devices: They convert the energy of the wave (KINETIC ENERGY) into potential energy.\r\n3)Oscillating Water Columns(OWCs):  They convert the energy of the wave ( KINETIC ENERGY) into air pressure.\r\nNow let us discuss the three kinds in detail!!\r\n\r\nA.WAVE PROFILE DEVICES\r\nWave profile devices are those devices that float on or near the sea surface and move in response to the shape of the incident wave. In the case of submersive devices, they move up and down according to the underwater pressure. Mostly wave profile devices float on the surface of the water, absorbing the wave energy in all directions by following the movement of the waves just like a float. Wave energy devices that use wave profiling have been in practical use for some time, although on a fairly small scale, they are used for powering navigation buoys. If the size of the wave profile device is very small compared to the periodic length of the wave then this type ofÂ wave energy deviceÂ is called point absorber. If the size of the device is longer than the typical periodic wavelength, it is called linear absorber or  wave attenuator. We can distinguish between the two wave power devices based on how they convert the wave energy between the absorber and reaction point.\r\nThe waveâ€™s energy is captured using vertical motion (heave), horizontal motion in the direction of the wave (surge), angular motion about a central axis parallel to the wave crests(pitch), or angular motion about a vertical axis (yaw) or a combination of all four types with the energy being generated by reacting these different movements against some kind of fixed resistance called aÂ reaction point. The pitching and heaving of the waves cause a relative motion between an absorber and a reaction point. A heavy ballast plate will be suspended below the floating buoy. As the buoy moves up and down in the waves, an oscillatory mutual force reaction is generated between the freely moving absorber and the heavy plate causing a hydraulic pump in between to rotate the generator turbine producing electricity.\r\nAnother device of this kind is the wave attenuator or linear absorber which actually floats on the surface of the water. As the waves pass along the length of this snake-like wave energy device, electricity is produced.\r\n\r\nB.WAVE CAPTURE DEVICES\r\nWave Capture Devices are also called as Overtopping Wave Power Devices. These kinds of devices capture the movements of the waves and tides and converts them to potential energy. Wave energy is converted into potential energy by lifting up the water to a higher level (i.e.) the device elevates the ocean waves to a reservoir at a higher level(above sea level). \r\n\r\nThe wave capture devices work much similar to the impoundment type hydroelectric dam. Here, we could see in the figure above that, the seawater is captured and impounded at a height above sea level, creating a low head situation which is then drained out through a reaction turbine  (KALPAN TURBINE), generating electricity. \r\nTheÂ wave overtopping deviceÂ uses a ramp design on the device to elevate a part of the incoming waves above their natural height. We now basically know how wave energy works and one of the main advantages of wave energy devices, is that apart from the generating turbine, there are no moving parts and hence mechanical wear and tear is drastically reduced. \r\n\r\nC.OSCILLATING WAVE COLUMNS\r\nOscillatory eave columns or OWCs in short are partially submerged structures that house a column of air above a column of water. It is normally positioned onto or near rocks or cliffs which are next to a deep-sea bottom. These devices convert wave energy into air pressure. The structure which is used to capture the waveâ€™s energy could be a natural cave with a blowhole or a man-made chamber with a wind turbine generator located at the top, much above the surface of the water. The type of turbine that is used here is called a Wells Turbine ( WIND TURBINE GENERATOR).\r\nAs the incident waves enter and exit the chamber, changes in wave movement cause the water level within the enclosure to oscillate up and down acting like a giant piston on the air, above the surface of the water, pushing it back and forth. This air is compressed and released, by this movement every cycle. Then the air is channelled through a wind turbine generator to produce electricity.\r\n\r\nNow, we have seen the different types of wave power devices that are used to harness energy from the waves. \r\nWave energy has a lot of potential. Oceans cover over 71% of the Earth, so it\'s very accessible. Wave energy also has many positive aspects. Firstly, the energy is green. Harnessing energy from the waves doesn\'t emit any harmful gases, and it can easily replace energies that do, such as using fossil fuels. Secondly, the energy is renewable. Thirdly, there is an incredible potential in wave energy. For every meter of wave along the shore, the energy density is estimated between 30 kW and 40 kW. Last but not least, wave energy is reliable. Solar always needs the Sun, and wind energy always needs the wind in order to work. Since waves are always in motion and never interrupted, it\'s a reliable source compared to others.\r\nThe development of wave energy requires an interdisciplinary approach. Harnessing energy from the waves is not just about the device and its capacity, but it deals with many socio-economic-environmental factors. Wave energy devices require a lot of maintenance for which the expenditure must be huge. It is unclear whether harnessing energy from the waves affects marine life or not. \r\nHowever, this form of clean, green and renewable energy has a lot of potential to generate power. Mother Nature is always bountiful. It provides us with everything that we need, NOT TO SATIATE OUR GREED!! So we must try to explore this field of harnessing wave energy so that we could reduce the usage of fossil fuels in power generation and inturn we could strive for a pollution-free, green environment!!\r\n\r\n-Arvind Sriram (2nd year)\r\n                                                    \r\n                                           \r\n\r\n');
